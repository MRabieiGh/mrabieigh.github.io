Designed 3D apparatus needed for electrode array implantation within inferior-temporal area of macaques. 
The apparatus is table-mounted and is required to rotate monkey's head during surgery to have it in a specific angle.
Some STL files of this design are shared within <a href="https://github.com/MRabieiGh/rotatable-stereotactic-apparatus"> this </a> link.

Designs are based on images of a working example of such apparatus.
