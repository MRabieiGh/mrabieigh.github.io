Assisted Prof. Dehaqani as Lead TA of EPS course for 4 consecutive semesters.

Description
======
Assisted Prof. Dehaqani as Lead TA of EPS course for 3 consecutive, semesters during which the course slides and recitations were prepared mainly based on MITâ€™s EPS course and prior exam samples from University of Tehran. After that, assisted one more semester as supervisor TA and project designer.

Probability course for electrical engineering students had been dominated by the Telecommunication and Control branches and their notations. As Dr. Dehaqani tried to revisit the course contents and add a more "statisticak" touch to it, I had helped by providing recitation materials, course homeworks, and later, course projects. I had also lead teams of TAs for 3 semesters, corrdinated the out-of-class aspects of the course.

Personal Experience
======
Engineering Probability and Statistics is a rather important course at University of Tehran's program, as it is a basic course that is taught in early semesters and helps laying a foundation of stochastic concepts upon which, other courses are developed. Therefore, it has lots of enrolled students in each semester which brings in the difficulty of managing such crowded class. This dificulty intensifies in the middle of the semester, as the contents become more abstract and students find it strugling to keep up with the program. However, wide range of topics covered in this course makes it more intriguing for teacher assistants, as they are able to simplify what they have learned in their higher levels of education and bring that down to the mindset of sophomore students.
