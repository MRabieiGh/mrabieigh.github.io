Assisted 7 groups of ~7 students during NMA summer school as a project TA of Computational Neuroscience, as they were forming and testing their hypothesis in the scope of computational neuroscience on ECoG and Neuronal datasets.

Description
======
The project TA role arose from a need to provide more expert support to the students during their project times. Although the regular pod TA will spend time on projects, they do not have as deep an understanding of the datasets as the project TAs do. In addition, project TAs will keep learning from their interactions with the different groups, and be able to redistribute their knowledge to all the other groups theyâ€™ve been assigned to.

About Neuromatch Academy
======
Neuromatch Academy (NMA) teaches computational techniques crucial for success in academia and industry. It serves thousands of students each year with hundreds of teaching assistants (TA). Students learn by solving problems in small groups and by running group projects; they learn in many languages in an incredibly supportive environment.
