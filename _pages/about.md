I am Mohammad Rabiei. I was born in Farokhshahr, Iran. I currently reside in Tehran, studying electrical engineering at Univrsity of Tehran.

Academic Background
======
Interested in mathematics and physics, I recieved my diploma in National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET). 
As I was studing electrical engineering, I got interested in control branch.
Graduated B.Sc. as rank 3.
Started my masters at the same university, Straight
Took machine learning courses
interested in system neuroscience

Projects related to Computational Neuroscience
======
1. Comparison of cateorical representation dynamics within inferior-temporal and pre-frontal cortex
   1. Using single unit data gathered from non-human primates
   2. Using electroencephalographic recordings from humans
2. Quantification of local field's information of spatial cues in macaque's frontal eye field in different cognitive states
3. Effects of L-Arginine and L-Name on spectral features of prefrontal cortex in Streptozotocin-induced models of alzheimer
4. Altertion of neural connectivity in Alzheimer model of rodents
5. Categorical representation dynamics of human brain, a SEEG study

Other Projects
------
1. Setting up the recording paradigm of Jajlab (The new electrophysiological labaratory located at primate center of Royan Institute)
2. Establishing a low-price stable system for recording from behaving rats
3. Rats as a visual model: How are Gabor stimuli characteristics decoded in hooded rats primary visual cortex?
4. Developing a table-mounted, low-cost, realtime eye-tracking system (as the bachelor's thesis)
5. Designing CT-Scan based surgical head-posts and recording chambers for macaques
6. Designing a basic stereotactic apparatus neeed for a specific electrode implanting surgery routine 
7. Hich Pich: A deep learning based approach to predict NFT prices based on the corresponding images

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
