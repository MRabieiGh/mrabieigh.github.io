I am Mohammad Rabiei. I was born in Farokhshahr, Iran. I currently reside in Tehran, studying electrical engineering at Univrsity of Tehran.

Background
======
Ever since I was a child, I was fascinated by the academia. No wonder that everyone in my family anticipated me pursuing research life, being a worm-book all over my adolescence. I was passionate about learning, about finding the answers to my questions. However, as I attended the electrical engineering department as a bachelor's student, that passion started to degrade. It took me awhile to finally realize that I would rather to be a scientist and not an engineer.

During my bachelor's, I developed an efficient, low-cost eye-tracking system for our laboratory under the supervision of Dr. Abolqasemi. This project opened my way into cognitive science and psychophysical studies. Realising how little we know about brain, that spark was ignited again. Albeit, researching in a developing country with the ongoing economic crisis has  I started studying neuroscience, worked in labs along physiologists, gathering and processing neural data from rats and monkeys. I assisted in establishing and stabilizing recording paradigm for behaving rats and head-fixed monkeys in BCoLab and Jajlab, respectively. Moreover, I helped analysing the recordings when needed. On my master's thesis, I'm currently working on ordinal and caregorical decoding of neural responses of macaque's prefrontal cortex and inferior temporal cortex and I aim at finding out whether if local dynamics associate such decodings and how the interactions between these two areas enhances the neural readability.

Having a lot of unanswered questions, I decided to continue research in neuroscience. I am interested in knowing how the brain perceives sensory information, how the different areas engage in daily cognitive tasks and what phenomenon in the brain activity builds up our perception of the environment. I am interested in higher-order associations in our brains that creates different layers of abstraction and high-level congitive functions, like perception and decision making.

<!-- As I am graduating my master's, I have had acquired a repertoire of skills necessary for neuroscience research, along with patience and perseverance and now, I'm eager to use them as a phd candidate. -->

<!-- Interested in mathematics and physics, I recieved my diploma in National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET). 
As I was studing electrical engineering, I got interested in control branch.
Graduated B.Sc. as rank 3.
Started my masters at the same university, Straight
Took machine learning courses
interested in system neuroscience -->

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository. -->
